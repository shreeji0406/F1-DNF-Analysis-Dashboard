**Overview** : This Power BI dashboard explores the factors contributing to DNFs (Did Not Finish) in Formula 1 races between 2021 and 2024. It was developed as part of a master’s course project at DePaul University to practice data visualization and storytelling with real-world racing data.

**Business Problem** : Formula 1 teams face heavy losses in points and costs when drivers fail to finish races. Despite access to advanced telemetry, many decisions are still reactive rather than predictive. This project analyzes historical race data to understand where and why DNFs occur, helping teams identify high-risk conditions, circuits, and drivers.

**Key Insights**
- Collisions are the leading cause of DNFs, followed by technical and mechanical failures.
- Saudi Arabia (Jeddah), Singapore, and Silverstone rank among the most DNF-prone circuits.
- Wet and cloudy weather conditions increase the likelihood of DNFs.
- Certain drivers, such as Bottas and Tsunoda, have higher incident counts, mainly linked to collisions and mechanical issues.

**Tools & Techniques**
- Power BI – dashboard design, data cleaning, and DAX calculations
- Excel & Power Query – preprocessing and categorizing DNF reasons
- Visualization Types: bar charts, pie charts, multi-axis comparisons, KPI cards, and filters

**Dataset** : Dataset includes driver names, circuit locations, weather conditions, DNF causes, and year of race events. (File: F1_DNF Dataset.xlsx)

**Outcome** : The dashboard highlights critical risk factors behind DNFs and encourages a data-driven, proactive racing strategy. It demonstrates how analytics can support performance improvement in high-risk environments like Formula 1.
